      An input source is basically a string literal, which represents either a string, refers to a file, an URL, or a builtin resource.

      *Template addresses:*

      A template address is intended to uniquely identify a template. A template address has the general format `<name>@<command>`, whereas
      the `<name>` is the local name of the template and `<command>` the address of the owning command.
      For details, please type `${applicationName} help :addresses`.

      *Template names:*

      A template can be referenced without the owning command in case it is referenced from within a command context. If so, the template
      name resolves to the best matching template address according to the currently executed command. For example, given the command with 
      address `foo/bar` and the template name `name`, it refers to the first template address that exists in the list. `name@foo/bar`, 
      `name@foo` or `name@`.

      *Command addresses:*

      A command address uniquely identifies a command in ${applicationName}. It is basically a path the command, so
      `foo/bar` refers to the command `bar` that is a child command of `foo`. The special empty path (``) refers to the root command that 
      represents the application itself. For details, please type `${applicationName} help :addresses`.
