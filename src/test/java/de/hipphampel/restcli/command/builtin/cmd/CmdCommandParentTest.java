            Usage
              cmd [<sub-command> [<sub-command-args>...]]

            Description
              This is a collection of commands to manage custom

              request, an alias or a group of other custom commands.
              `cmd` is a collection of sub commands and has no

              [<sub-command-args>...]
                  Arguments passed to the sub-command.
