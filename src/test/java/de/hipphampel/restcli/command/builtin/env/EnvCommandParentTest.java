            env - Collection of commands to manage environments.

            Usage
              env [<sub-command> [<sub-command-args>...]]

            Description
              An environment is a set of configuration settings. When
              executing a command - especially REST requests - the
              settings of the current environment are applied to this
              request, i.e. in terms of (additional) headers, variables,
              or request timeout.
              test-app allows to manage as many environments as you
              like, each environment is identified by an unique name.
              `env` is a collection of sub commands and has no
              functionality apart from grouping the commands. See the
              following list for the available sub commands.

            Arguments and options
              <sub-command>
                  The name of the sub command to execute. See the list
                  below for the available sub-commands.
              [<sub-command-args>...]
                  Arguments passed to the sub-command.

            Available sub-commands
              cp  - Creates a copy of an environment.
              exp - Exports an environment.
              get - Gets the settings of an environment.
              imp - Imports an environment.
              ls  - Lists available environments.
              mod - Modifies an existing environment.
              mv  - Renames an existing environment.
              new - Creates a new environment.
              rm  - Removes environments.
            """,
        "");
